**Status**: Accepted

---

## Context

This section describes the "why" behind the decision. It outlines the problem, the driving factors, and any constraints.

* **Problem**: With the proliferation of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, teams need a systematic approach to selecting and integrating appropriate servers for their agentic workflows. Poor server selection can lead to security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or inadequate functionality for the intended use cases.

* **Drivers**:
    * Need for secure, controlled AI agent interactions with external systems
    * Requirement for up-to-date documentation and library information
    * Demand for version control integration and code management
    * Performance considerations for local vs remote server deployments
    * Security requirements for handling sensitive data and credentials
    * Scalability needs for team-wide AI agent deployments
    * Integration requirements with existing development workflows

* **Constraints**:
    * Trust and security implications of running third-party MCP servers
    * Authentication complexity for various external services
    * Network latency for remote server communications
    * Resource consumption of local server instances
    * Compatibility requirements with different AI platforms (Claude, Gemini)
    * Limited documentation for emerging MCP servers

## Considered Options

Here are the different solutions that were evaluated to address the problem.

### 1. Local-Only MCP Servers

Deploy only local MCP servers running on developer machines for maximum security and control.

* **Pros**:
    * Complete control over code execution
    * No external dependencies or network latency
    * Maximum security for sensitive data
    * No authentication complexity
* **Cons**:
    * Limited to local resources and capabilities
    * Cannot access cloud services or APIs
    * Resource intensive on developer machines
    * No access to specialized remote services

### 2. Remote-Only MCP Servers

Use exclusively remote MCP servers hosted by service providers.

* **Pros**:
    * No local resource consumption
    * Access to powerful cloud-based capabilities
    * Automatic updates and maintenance
    * Centralized management for teams
* **Cons**:
    * Security risks with third-party code execution
    * Network dependency and latency issues
    * Potential data privacy concerns
    * Ongoing service costs

### 3. Hybrid MCP Server Architecture

Implement a strategic mix of local and remote MCP servers based on specific use cases and security requirements.

* **Pros**:
    * Flexibility to choose optimal deployment per use case
    * Balance security with functionality
    * Leverage both local and cloud capabilities
    * Risk mitigation through selective trust
    * Cost optimization
* **Cons**:
    * Complex configuration management
    * Need for clear selection criteria
    * Multiple authentication mechanisms
    * Training requirements for proper usage

## Decision

This section clearly states the chosen option and provides the reasoning behind the choice.

**Chosen Option**: **Hybrid MCP Server Architecture**

**Justification**:
We chose the Hybrid MCP Server Architecture to maximize flexibility while maintaining security. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both local and remote servers while mitigating their respective weaknesses.

**Core MCP Server Stack**:

1. **Context7 (Remote)** - For up-to-date library documentation
   - Purpose: Access current documentation and code examples
   - Deployment: Remote HTTPS/SSE endpoint
   - Authentication: API key
   - Trust Level: Medium (read-only operations)

2. **GitHub MCP Server (Docker/Remote)** - For version control operations
   - Purpose: Manage pull requests, issues, and repository operations
   - Deployment: Local Docker or remote API
   - Authentication: Personal Access Token
   - Trust Level: High (can modify repository)

3. **Filesystem Server (Local)** - For local file operations
   - Purpose: Read/write project files
   - Deployment: Local NPX or Docker
   - Authentication: None (local permissions)
   - Trust Level: Maximum (full filesystem access)

4. **Sequential Thinking (Local)** - For complex reasoning tasks
   - Purpose: Break down complex problems
   - Deployment: Local NPX
   - Authentication: None
   - Trust Level: High (executes reasoning chains)

**Selection Criteria for New MCP Servers**:

1. **Security Assessment**:
   - What permissions does the server require?
   - Is the source code auditable?
   - What data will be transmitted?

2. **Deployment Model**:
   - Local: For sensitive operations or high-frequency calls
   - Remote: For specialized services or team-shared resources

3. **Authentication Method**:
   - Prefer environment variables over hardcoded credentials
   - Use Docker secrets for containerized deployments
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 for user-specific access

4. **Performance Requirements**:
   - Latency tolerance for the use case
   - Frequency of server calls
   - Resource consumption considerations

## Consequences

Every decision has outcomes. This section outlines the expected positive and negative consequences.

* **Positive Consequences**:
    * Optimal performance through strategic server placement
    * Enhanced security through selective trust boundaries
    * Access to best-in-class capabilities from specialized servers
    * Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
    * Cost optimization through selective remote service usage
    * Team-wide consistency through shared configuration
    * Enable complex agentic workflows with appropriate tools

* **Negative Consequences / Risks**:
    * Configuration complexity for multiple server types
    * Increased attack surface with remote servers
    * Dependency on external service availability
    * Authentication token management overhead
    * Potential for server sprawl without governance
    * Learning curve for server selection criteria

* **Mitigation**:
    * Document clear server selection guidelines
    * Implement centralized configuration management
    * Use secure credential storage (e.g., .env files, secret managers)
    * Regular security audits of installed MCP servers
    * Monitor server usage and performance metrics
    * Create team playbooks for common server configurations
    * Establish server approval process for production use
    * Implement fallback strategies for critical remote servers
    * Use the `--mcp-debug` flag for troubleshooting
    * Maintain inventory of approved MCP servers with trust levels
