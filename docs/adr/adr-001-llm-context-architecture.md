# ADR: 001 - LLM Context Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

This section describes the "why" behind the decision. It outlines the problem, the driving factors, and any constraints.

* **Problem**: Generic LLMs fail to deliver meaningful results in production software development due to lack of project-specific context. MIT research suggests a 95% failure rate for generative AI business projects, primarily due to the "learning gap" where LLMs don't understand the specific codebase, architectural decisions, or business requirements.

* **Drivers**:
    * Need to reduce hallucinations and incorrect code suggestions from LLMs
    * Requirement for AI agents to understand project-specific patterns and conventions
    * Demand for consistent architectural alignment in AI-generated code
    * Developer frustration with generic, non-contextual AI responses
    * Evolution from simple code completion to complex agentic workflows
    * Shift in developer role from pure coding to "AI collaboration"

* **Constraints**:
    * Context window limitations in current LLMs (even with 1M+ tokens)
    * Need for structured, machine-readable documentation formats
    * Balance between comprehensive context and processing efficiency
    * Maintenance overhead of keeping context documentation updated
    * Security considerations when exposing codebase context to AI services

## Considered Options

Here are the different solutions that were evaluated to address the problem.

### 1. Ad-hoc Context Provision

Developers manually paste code snippets and explanations into chat interfaces as needed.

* **Pros**:
    * No setup or maintenance required
    * Quick for one-off questions
    * Full control over what context is shared
* **Cons**:
    * Context lost between sessions
    * Inconsistent results across team members
    * Time-consuming for complex queries
    * No reusability of context
    * Prone to incomplete or missing context

### 2. Comprehensive Project Documentation

Create extensive README files and wiki-style documentation for human consumption that AI can reference.

* **Pros**:
    * Serves dual purpose for humans and AI
    * Natural language format is easy to write
    * Existing documentation can be leveraged
* **Cons**:
    * Often becomes outdated quickly
    * Lacks structured format for machine parsing
    * May contain ambiguous or imprecise language
    * Difficult to validate completeness

### 3. Structured Context Framework

Implement a formal framework using ADRs, User Stories, OpenAPI specs, and schema definitions as a "briefing packet" for AI agents.

* **Pros**:
    * Provides structured, machine-readable context
    * Captures the "why" behind decisions (ADRs)
    * Defines clear business objectives (User Stories)
    * Ensures API contract clarity (OpenAPI)
    * Maintains data model consistency (Schemas)
    * Reusable across different AI tools and team members
    * Aligns with Context-Driven Development principles
* **Cons**:
    * Requires initial setup effort
    * Needs ongoing maintenance
    * Team training on documentation standards
    * Additional tooling for context management

## Decision

This section clearly states the chosen option and provides the reasoning behind the choice.

**Chosen Option**: **Structured Context Framework**

**Justification**:
We chose the Structured Context Framework because it addresses the core problem of the "learning gap" identified in AI deployment failures. By treating the LLM as a "brilliant new colleague who just joined the team," we provide comprehensive onboarding through structured documentation. This approach:

1. **Reduces hallucinations** by providing factual, structured information about the project
2. **Ensures consistency** across team members and AI sessions
3. **Captures rationale** through ADRs, preventing AI from suggesting already-rejected solutions
4. **Defines clear objectives** through User Stories, aligning AI output with business goals
5. **Provides technical precision** through schemas and API specifications
6. **Enables the "Plan, Propose, Proceed" pattern** for safe agentic workflows

The framework consists of:
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document the "why" behind technical choices
- **User Stories**: Define the "who" and "what" of features
- **OpenAPI Specifications**: Specify the "how" of API interactions
- **Database/Data Schemas**: Define the "language" of data
- **Pydantic Models**: Provide type-safe data contracts

## Consequences

Every decision has outcomes. This section outlines the expected positive and negative consequences.

* **Positive Consequences**:
    * Dramatic improvement in AI-generated code quality and relevance
    * Reduced time spent correcting AI suggestions
    * Better architectural consistency in AI-generated code
    * Knowledge preservation and team onboarding benefits
    * Enablement of complex agentic workflows with MCP servers
    * Transformation of developer role to effective "AI collaborator"
    * Reusable context across different AI tools (Claude, Gemini, etc.)

* **Negative Consequences / Risks**:
    * Initial time investment to create documentation framework
    * Ongoing maintenance burden to keep context current
    * Risk of documentation drift if not properly maintained
    * Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with ADRs or structured documentation
    * Potential for over-documentation leading to context bloat

* **Mitigation**:
    * Implement documentation as part of the development workflow, not as an afterthought
    * Use automated tools to validate schema and API spec consistency
    * Create templates and examples to reduce documentation friction
    * Regular documentation reviews during sprint retrospectives
    * Start with minimal viable context and expand based on actual needs
    * Leverage MCP servers like Context7 for automatic documentation updates
    * Monitor AI performance metrics to validate context effectiveness
