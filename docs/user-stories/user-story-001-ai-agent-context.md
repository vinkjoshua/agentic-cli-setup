# User Story: AI Agent Context Management

## Story ID: US-001

### Title
Automated Project Context Briefing for AI Agents

---

## User Story

**As a** software developer working with AI coding assistants  
**I want to** automatically provide comprehensive project context to AI agents  
**So that** I receive accurate, project-specific code suggestions without manual context provision

---

## Context

Based on MIT research showing a 95% failure rate in generative AI projects, the primary cause is the "learning gap" where AI models lack project-specific context. Developers currently waste significant time correcting generic AI suggestions that don't align with project architecture, conventions, or business requirements. This story addresses the need for automated context provision following the "briefing packet" approach, treating the AI as a new team member requiring comprehensive onboarding.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a developer initiates an AI coding session  
   **When** the AI agent is activated  
   **Then** the agent automatically loads all relevant project context (ADRs, schemas, APIs, user stories)

2. **Given** project context documents exist in the standardized format  
   **When** an AI agent processes a coding request  
   **Then** the agent's response aligns with documented architectural decisions and patterns

3. **Given** a developer asks about a specific API endpoint  
   **When** the AI agent responds  
   **Then** the response references the correct OpenAPI specification and follows defined contracts

4. **Given** context documents are updated  
   **When** a new AI session begins  
   **Then** the agent uses the latest version of all context documents

5. **Given** an AI agent encounters a previously rejected solution (documented in ADRs)  
   **When** generating suggestions  
   **Then** the agent avoids proposing the rejected approach and explains why

## Technical Considerations

### AI Context Requirements
- [ ] Relevant ADRs referenced: ADR-001 (LLM Context Architecture), ADR-002 (MCP Server Selection)
- [ ] API endpoints affected: /api/context/load, /api/context/validate, /api/context/update
- [ ] Data schemas involved: ContextDocument, AgentConfiguration, ProjectMetadata
- [ ] MCP servers required: Context7, filesystem, git

### Implementation Notes
- Context loading should happen within 2 seconds to avoid session delays
- Support incremental context updates without full reload
- Implement context validation to ensure completeness
- Maximum context size should respect LLM token limits (1M for Claude, Gemini)
- Use structured formats (JSON, YAML) for machine parsing

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Context loader implemented with support for ADRs, User Stories, OpenAPI, and Schemas
- [ ] Automatic context discovery from project structure
- [ ] Context validation ensures all required documents present
- [ ] Performance metrics show <2 second load time
- [ ] Integration with Claude Code and Gemini CLI verified
- [ ] Context caching implemented for session persistence
- [ ] Documentation updated with context structure guidelines
- [ ] AI agents demonstrably produce better results with context

## Story Points
8

## Priority
High

## Sprint
Sprint 1

## Dependencies
- Project structure must follow defined documentation standards
- MCP servers must be configured and authenticated
- AI platforms must support context injection

## Notes
- Consider implementing a context quality score to measure documentation completeness
- Future enhancement: Auto-generate context from code analysis
- Monitor token usage to optimize context size

## AI Agent Guidance

### Context Summary
This feature implements an automated context loading system that provides AI agents with comprehensive project knowledge at session start. The system reads structured documentation (ADRs for architectural decisions, User Stories for requirements, OpenAPI for API contracts, and Schemas for data models) and injects them into the AI's context window. This transforms the AI from a generic code generator into a project-aware team member that understands your specific codebase, conventions, and business requirements.

### Example Usage
```python
# When a developer starts an AI session
ai_session = AgentSession()
context = ProjectContextLoader()
context.load_from_directory("./docs")
context.validate_completeness()
ai_session.inject_context(context)

# The AI now has access to:
# - All architectural decisions and their rationale
# - User stories defining feature requirements
# - API specifications for accurate endpoint usage
# - Data schemas for correct model interactions

# Developer asks: "How should I implement user authentication?"
# AI responds based on ADR-003 which documents the decision to use JWT tokens
# rather than sessions, including the reasoning and implementation details
```
